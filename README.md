# Tank V3

Navigational tanks created to supplement student coding curriculum in ENES100.

The tank has swappable propulsion modules, including a few seen here:

In order to remove the propulsion modules, remove the wheels by turning counter clockwise and then slide the module out.


## Prerequesites

1. Have Arduino installed on your computer. The download link can be found [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
2. Download the ENES 100 library [here](http://enes100.umd.edu/libraries/enes100)
3. Download the Tank library [here](http://enes100.umd.edu/libraries/tank)

## Programming the Tank

The front of the tank is marked by the forward facing arrow.

### Motor Code

The code below will help you move your tank forward.
```ino
#include "Tank.h"
  void setup(){
      Tank.begin();
  }

  //repeats forever unless end is specified
  void loop(){
    //turns on both motors to full speed (-255 to 255 are acceptable PWM values)
    Tank.setRightMotorPWM(255);
    Tank.setLeftMotorPWM(255);
    delay(1000);
    Tank.turnOffMotors();
  }
```

### Ultrasonic Sensor Code

```ino
#include "Tank.h"
void setup() {
  Tank.begin();
}
void loop() {
  Tank.setRightMotorPWM(pwm);
}
```
### Wifi Module code

The following code will allow you to connect to the vision system, and prints a message.

```ino
#include "Enes100.h" //libraries are included at the very top of the program
#include "Tank.h"

void setup() {
  //This function connects the tank to the vision system. The TX and RX pins of the tanks are 52 and 50 respectively.
  Enes100.begin("Alec B Lahr", MATERIAL, arucoID, 52, 50);

 delay(200);

  Enes100.println("Sucessfully connected to the Vision System"); // print some text in Serial Monitor
}
```

## Coordinates and Movement Challenge:

- Write an arduino program to get the coordinates of the aruco marker from the vision system.
- Print it to the vision system.
- Use the ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles and avoid them by turning.
- Use the location data from the vision system to find your way past the log or the limbo to the end.
- You can choose to do this however you like!

## Pin Diagram

In case you would like to write your own functions, here are the pinouts for the tanks:

```ino
#define PIN_MOTOR_1_FORWARD 11
#define PIN_MOTOR_1_REVERSE 10
#define PIN_MOTOR_2_FORWARD 9
#define PIN_MOTOR_2_REVERSE 8
#define PIN_MOTOR_3_FORWARD 4
#define PIN_MOTOR_3_REVERSE 5
#define PIN_MOTOR_4_FORWARD 2
#define PIN_MOTOR_4_REVERSE 3
// Bump Sensors
#define PIN_BUMP_FRONT 32
#define PIN_BUMP_REAR 33
// Ultrasonic Sensors
#define PIN_US_FRONT_TRIG 18
#define PIN_US_FRONT_ECHO 19
#define PIN_US_REAR_TRIG 27
#define PIN_US_REAR_ECHO 26
// Infrared Sensors
#define PIN_IR_1 15
#define PIN_IR_2 17
#define PIN_IR_3 14
#define PIN_IR_4 16
// WiFi Modules
#define PIN_WIFI_TX 52
#define PIN_WIFI_RX 50
```
